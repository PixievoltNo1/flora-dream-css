  This is where you can add your custom CSS and design what you think should be the default styles of the Web. The CSS sky's the limit, but keep in mind that the page should remain accessible (eg. high contrasting colors and font sizes)

  When you're done, add #codejam #mycssreset to this project's description. HAPPY JAMMING!

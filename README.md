# Your Dream Default Stylesheet #codejam #dreamcss

Times New Roman, blue links…we’re all familiar with the default CSS of web pages. This jam, though, we’re imagining what the default style would be if _you_ had control. Remix this project and **only update style.css** - no editing index.html, no adding files, and definitely no JavaScript. Use your imagination with CSS, and make sure to keep it accessible!

Submit your remix any time through the month of January by updating the project description to include “#codejam #dreamcss". You can learn more about this and past jams at [glitch.com/jams)(https://glitch.com/jams/)

We asked the Glitch team and the community for some of their favorite CSS tools and resources, maybe they'll help inspire you!

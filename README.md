This was my submission for [Glitch's #dreamcss January 2024 Code Jam](https://support.glitch.com/t/new-year-new-jam-new-css-defaults-with-dreamcss/65573?u=pixievoltno1), in which the challenge was to redesign a web page changing only its CSS file and imagine a new default look for the Web. Being the femboy I am, I went all Softness and Flowery Colors~ With [the Glitch hosting service shut down](https://support.glitch.com/t/discussion-thread-project-hosting-ending-july-8/75660), I made this repo to keep the pretty thing I made preserved on the Internet.
